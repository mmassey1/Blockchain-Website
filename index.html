<div><h1>You may be wondering, <i>what even is a blockchain anyway?</i></h1>
<h2>Well, first let me explain what a <b>block</b> is.</h2></div>
<h3>What is a 'block?'</h3>
<p><ul>
	<li>In terms of cryptology, a block is defined as a place in blockchain where information is stored and encrypted.
</li>
<li>Blocks are identified by long numbers that include encrypted transaction information from previous blocks and new transaction information.
</li>
<li>Blocks are important in database management.
</li>
</ul></p>

<h4>Each block has 3 main elements, which are:</h4>
<ol>
	<li><b>Data</b>: The type of data depends on what the blockchain is being used for. In Bitcoin, for example, a block’s data contains the details about the transaction including sender, receiver, number of coins, and so on.</li>
	<li><b>Hash</b>: A hash in blockchain is something like a fingerprint or signature. It identifies a block and all its content, and it’s always unique.</li>
	<li><b>Hash of previous block</b>: This piece is precisely what makes a blockchain! Because each block carries the information of the previous block, the chain becomes very secure.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>To put it simply, a block stores information. It can store many pieces of information while occupying small amounts of space.
<br>When used in cryptocurrency, a block maintains a record of transactions, which helps the system keep track of what happens during a transaction.
</b></p>

<h2>What is 'blockchain'?</h2>
<p>Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. 
</p>
<footer><h3>Remember...</h3>
<p>Blockchain stores information in batches called blocks. These blocks are linked together in a sequential way to form a continuous line. A chain of blocks. A blockchain. Each block is like a page of a ledger or a record book.</p></footer>
