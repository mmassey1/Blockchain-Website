<h2>Now that I've properly introduced the concept of a blockchain, let's talk about how people use it!</h2>
<article>
	<p>Since its introduction, blockchain has been adopted for a wide range of uses even beyond just cryptocurrencies. It has the potential to revolutionize many different industries by providing a secure and transparent way to track and verify transactions. Some potential uses for blockchain include <ul>
		<li>Financial transactions: Blockchain can be used to facilitate secure and transparent financial transactions, such as the transfer of money or the trading of assets.</li>
		<li>Supply chain management: Blockchain can be used to track the movement of goods through the supply chain, providing greater transparency and accountability.

</li>
		<li>Identity verification: Blockchain can be used to securely store and verify identity information, making it easier to confirm the identity of individuals or organizations.

</li>
		<li>Voting systems: Blockchain can be used to create secure and transparent voting systems, which could help to improve the integrity and trustworthiness of elections.

</li>
		<li>Medical record keeping: Blockchain can be used to store and manage medical records, providing a secure and accessible way to track and share patient information.

</li>
		<li>Art and collectibles: Blockchain can be used to authenticate and track the ownership of art, antiques, and other collectibles, helping to combat fraud and improve the security of the market.

</li>
	</ul>However, the 2 most popular uses for blockchain currently are <u>cryptocurrency and NFTs.</u></p>

<h3>Limitations of Blockchain</h3>	
<p>While the potential uses for blockchain are vast, it is still a relatively new technology and there are many challenges to its widespread adoption.
