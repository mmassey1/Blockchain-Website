<header>So, now that you know what blocks and blockchain are...<div><img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/962517292/vector/blockchain-technology-concept.jpg?b=1&s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=PmeIl-zpyxZCY0O8DhpuyuyA0DC6wRcnVzrhPTZN6ZI=" class="headerphoto"></div></header>
<p>Why do people use it?
<br> How do they work?</p>
<h3>How does a blockchain work?</h3>
<hr>
<article>
<p>A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. 
</p>
<p>Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participantâ€™s ledger.</p>
<p>The decentralized database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).<img id="page2photo" src="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355223429/figure/fig1/AS:1079123124457479@1634294410909/The-properties-of-distributed-ledger-technology-39.ppm">

</p>
<p>Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.
</p>

<h3>Elements of a blockchain:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Magic number</b>: A number containing specific values that identify that block as part of a particular cryptocurrency's network.
</li>
	<li><b>Block size</b>: Sets the size limit on the block so that only a specific amount of information can be written in it.
</li>
	<li><b>Block header</b>: Contains information about the block.
</li>
	<li><b>Transaction counter</b>: A number that represents how many transactions are stored in the block.
</li>
	<li><b>Transactions</b>: A list of all of the transactions within a block.
</li>

</ul>
<h3>Benefits of Blockchain</h3>
<p><h5>Not immune to hacking (risk is low)</h5>
	<br>Because of its decentralized nature and cryptographic security measures, blockchain can reduce the risk of fraud and other forms of financial crime
<br><h5>Decentralized</h5>
<br>One of the key benefits of blockchain is that it is decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by a single entity or organization. This can make it more resistant to censorship and tampering, as there is no central point of control.
<br><h5>More people = more secure</h5>
<br>Blockchain uses cryptography to secure transactions, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to access or modify data. This can make it a more secure option for storing and transferring sensitive information.
<br><h5>Data available to everyone = transparency </h5>
<br> The transparency and security of blockchain can help to build trust between parties, which can be important in industries where trust is a key factor.
